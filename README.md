# A simple static gallery and blog website.
Just play around with vanilla JS, HTML, CSS to create a Single Page App simulator. My English is not good. So, this Readme file may be confusing. Sorry about that!

# Notes
This app requires a local server to load CSS, script files and internet connection to fetch images, fonts. You need to set up a few simple things in case you want to run this repository.

> **Why?**

We need to be serving the index.html file locally or have a hosted on a live server somewhere for the Fetch API to work properly. The files need to be served using the http or https protocols.

# Installation
I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extensions. Then, open root html file (index.html) by VSCode and click `Go Live` (see image below). Live Server will open this app on a port of your localhost.
